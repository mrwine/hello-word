# hello-word

Hi HISP teams!


***Goal for this repo***: *Getting started with Github to improve versioning and translation of training material and collaboration between teams*

Matthieu here. I would love to streamline the production of dhis2 training documents, so I'm exploring:

* Github
* Pandoc
* Mardown
* and much more

I hope that it will lead to some improvement :)
